                    <div><strong> 1. What are the ways in which I can claim a CarWale offer?</strong></div>
                    <div class="margin-top10">Ans: CarWale offers are limited quantity offers. They can be claimed in two ways</div>
                    <div class="margin-top10 margin-left20">
                        i) By booking a car at the associated dealership with a valid coupon code when the offer is still available on the site. The dealer then helps the user claim his offer.<br /><br />
                        ii) By making a pre-booking payment online with CarWale to provisionally claim the offer. The user then needs to visit the associated dealership within the next 15 days to confirm his booking by paying the complete booking amount and finishing off other booking formalities.
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div><strong> 2. How is my pre-booking amount being used?</strong></div>
                    <div class="margin-top10">Ans: The pre-booking amount is to facilitate instant reservation of the offer item. It would get adjusted in the payment you would make for the car purchase.</div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div><strong> 3. What is meant by 'claiming an offer'?</strong></div>
                    <div class="margin-top10">Ans: The offers being of a limited quantity nature, users have to be among the first to reserve their claim on an offer item by booking early. When an offer gets claimed for a user, it means the offer item is reserved for the user until he/she takes delivery of the car. The offer item is shipped to the user only post-delivery, when the user has completed all purchase formalities.</div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div><strong> 4. How do I claim an offer using my coupon code?</strong></div>
                    <div class="margin-top10">Ans: You can claim an offer using your coupon code by booking the indicated car at the associated dealership. Please show the dealership the SMS or Email having the coupon code and request his/her assistance in claiming the offer for you.</div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div><strong> 5. How do I claim an offer when I am pre-booking a car online?</strong></div>
                    <div class="margin-top10">Ans: In case you are pre-booking a car online by paying the pre-booking amount, the offer item gets automatically reserved for you, for a period of 15 days. When you complete the booking formalities within the next 15 days, the offer reservation gets confirmed, and you can then get the gift item once you take delivery of the car. There is no separate claim process in this case.</div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div><strong> 6. What happens when I cancel a booking at a dealership?</strong></div>
                    <div class="margin-top10">Ans: In case you cancel a booking at the dealership, after having completed the booking formalities, any cancellation would follow the dealership’s cancellation process. In this case the dealership would take care of any refunds, as maybe applicable, inclusive of the pre-booking amount, which CarWale would have transferred to the dealership on your behalf.
