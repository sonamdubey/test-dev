                    <p><strong>CarWale accepts the pre-booking amount from you as a means of ensuring your claim on an offer</strong> in an instantaneous manner. This pre-booking amount is accepted by us on behalf of our dealer partner, at whose dealership you would have to complete your booking for you to be able to confirm your offer claim, in the absence of doing which within 15 days, your offer reservation can be held null and void.</p>
                    <p>As the <strong>pre-booking amount is accepted by CarWale on behalf of the associated dealership,</strong> all requests for refund of the pre-booking money would be carried ahead only after checking with the respective dealership and with their expressing to us that you as a customer have no open commitments with the dealership.</p>
                    <p><strong>In cases where the user has undertaken no further transactions with the respective dealership</strong> after pre-booking with CarWale, and where the dealership confirms to this fact, CarWale can process the refund of the user’s money on their own account, and the user would be credited the money within 10 days of confirmation of all conditions having been met. Any deductions on the pre-booking amount with regards to transaction charges or cancellation charges as maybe demanded by the respective dealership, or any decision to deny a refund in certain cases would be at the discretion of CarWale.</p>
                    <p><strong>In cases where the user has proceeded with booking a car with the respective dealership,</strong> in the event of cancellation of booking, the pre-booking amount maybe refunded to the user along with any other booking charges he/she may have paid to the dealership, on terms which are completely at the discretion of the dealership. CarWale has no obligations or responsibilities to the user in this event and wouldn’t be in a position to process any refunds or give any information on the overall booking or cancellation process. In cases where the user has proceeded with booking a car, and doesn’t intend to cancel the booking, no refund of the CarWale pre-booking amount would be possible, as the pre-booking amount then gets added to the user’s monetary obligation to the dealer with regards to the car purchase.</p>
                    <p><strong>We urge you to also go through our</strong> <a href="/offerTermsAndConditions.aspx" target="_blank" class="blue">Offers Terms and Conditions</a> to get a complete picture of all terms covering the offer process.</p>
