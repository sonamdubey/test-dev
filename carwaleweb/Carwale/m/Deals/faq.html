                            Cars can only be registered for addresses within the city that you are buying in. You cannot buy a car from a dealer in one city for registration / delivery in another city. Please choose a dealer in the particular city where you wish to buy the car. E.g. If you live in Delhi and wish to buy a car in Mumbai, then you should book online with a Mumbai dealer.

                            You are free to purchase the insurance on your own as well. In this case the insurance premium amount that was included in the on-road price of the car will be reduced and the balance is payable to the dealer.
