            <cw:content><![CDATA[<p><p>The Tata Pixel, a new city car concept for Europe with 'Zero Turn' drive and an innovative diamond-shaped door system, is on display at the Auto Expo 2012. Based on the Tata Nano, the Pixel - at just over three metres in length - is the most package-efficient 4-seater in the world, comfortably accommodating four adults, unlike a typical city car which is either a two-seater or can accommodate two adults and two children only.</p><p>The Tata Pixel's ability to manoeuvre and park in the tightest of spaces is made possible by its Zero Turn toroidal traction-drive Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT). This highly efficient, cost-effective system assists rotation of the outer rear wheel forwards and the inner rear wheel backwards during low-speed manoeuvres, while the front wheels turn at acute angles. The result is a turning circle radius of just 2.6 metres. The 'scissor' doors rotate upwards from the front to allow all four passengers to effortlessly enter or exit the Tata Pixel, even in the tightest of spaces, while the doors' large glass area provides excellent visibility. A forward sweeping roofline, with minimal front and rear overhangs, accentuates the youthful styling, while the window graphic features an interchangeable island that can be used to change the exterior appearance whenever desired.</p><p>The Tata Pixel also introduces 'My Tata Connect' -- the first integrated human-machine interface (HMI) concept from Tata Motors for its new generation programmes. 'My Tata Connect' enables seamless integration of the user's smartphone or tablet with the vehicle's infotainment system and also allows controlling key functions of the car. This provides a customised, user friendly, all-in-one touch screen display, while also allowing the driver to remain seamlessly connected to the external world. In addition to serving as the infotainment display when docked in the instrument panel, the tablet also allows temperature, ventilation and air-conditioning settings to be adjusted through its touch screen, as well as displaying information on the vehicle's performance.A 1.2 litre three-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine, positioned at the rear of the Tata Pixel, gives lively performance.</p><div></div></p>]]></cw:content>

            <cw:content><![CDATA[<p><p>Mercedes-Benz utilized the Auto Expo to launch a new platform apart from launching 2 new cars.Mb.Inspired: The philosophy of Best or Nothing has always inspired Mercedes-Benz as a guiding philosophy. It has not just inspired Mercedes-Benz in pioneering many innovations, it has also helped Mercedes-Benz vehicles to be the best in the auto industry and many more. Mercedes-Benz would be promoting this philosophy in India through the mb.Inspired Initiative. &nbsp;A new India is on the rise and its all about youth and rising aspirations. It&rsquo;s a India which is fearless about taking risks and doesn&rsquo;t fear failure. Mercedes-Benz commemorates these young youth inspirational icons through Mb. Inspired</p><p>SLS AMG ROADSTER</p><p>After captivating hearts across the world the SLS AMG Roadster is all set to scorch the Indian road with pulsating speed. The open top SLS AMG Roadster exudes graceful dynamism and magnetic allure. The purist, athletic design immediately captures the attention. The Roadster&rsquo;s perfect proportions make it particularly impressive. The exterior of this German beauty conveys aggression and dominance with its governing radiator grille. &nbsp;The lightweight construction, combined with sensuous open air driving pleasure exudes its lively sporty presence.</p><p>NEW M-CLASS</p><p><img src="http://img.carwale.com/ec/8552/img/l/8602.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>Continuing in true M-Class tradition the third generation of this vehicle sets new benchmarks in SUV design, technology and performance. Pioneering the interpretation of a contemporary SUV, the New M-Class sports a powerful exterior and an interior featuring high-quality details. The vehicle leads the field in terms of safety, comfort, quality feel. It is the benchmark for comfort and load compartment capacity and offers ease of handling on and off-road.</p><p>The new M-Class has been envisioned with a much sleeker frame. Though the vehicle is significantly larger than its predecessor it does not make it look bulkier. There is an overall increase in the length and width of the car with the height being dropped. New engine hood design and LED lights have made the front of the car look sportier; the new tail lights have given the car an elegant feel.</p><p>A true off-roader the New M-Class has been fitted with technology that would help customized settings for engine performance, automatic transmission, anti-lock braking system (ABS), Electronic Stability Program (ESP) and Electronic Traction System all at the touch of the off-button on the console. The ease of technology makes the New M-Class a joy to ride off the beaten road.</p></p><p><img src="http://img.carwale.com/ec/8552/img/l/8605.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></cw:content>
