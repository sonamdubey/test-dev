    <p class="article-paragraph">A picture is worth a thousand words, they say, so we've got Kapil Angane, our resident photographer, to say a little over ten thousand words about his time behind the camera at the BikeWale Track Day 2016. Here are his picks:</p>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/01.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">A symmetrical photo doesn't usually look good, but this photo breaks the rules. It delivers the message of aggression in the Yamaha YZF-R3's design effectively, and also conveys the location effectively, with the iconic arch of the MMRT in the background.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/02.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The track may be wet, but Omkar's body language suggests that he's committed anyway. The rest of the photo is a blur, which conveys speed and motion, making it a dynamic image.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/03.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">There isn't any motion blur in this image, but you know that there's a lot of speed involved anyway. The committed posture, the high angle of lean… and you always wonder – did he manage to get his knee down in another frame?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/04.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">We go back to motion blur with the Apache's image – but the subject itself is in sharp focus. You can see Ranjan is relaxed despite being at lean. Full marks for the Apache, then. And the photographer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/05.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The Apache isn't as quick as a 600cc motorcycle… or is it? Pratheek's body posture is far more committed that that of Charles, and mid-corner, the Apache offers more confidence than the TNT 600i ABS for sure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/06.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">There's committed, and then there's muscling the motorcycle around the corner. Here you can see Pratheek leaning further than usual, and there is tension in his shoulders, conveying that getting the Benelli around a corner can be quite a physical affair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/07.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">Underseat twin exhausts might feel like an anachronism, but on the TNT 600i, they work well. So well, in fact, that none of us prefer looking at it from any other angle. The triangular theme with the exhaust tips and tail-lamp add symmetry to the design and photograph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/08.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The TNT 600i might be a motorcycle that you muscle around a corner, but here Charles manages to lean it quite a bit. The body position suggests that he's tentative, but the Benelli itself looks comfortable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/09.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">God is in the details, they say, and the Panigale has many details that surprise you. None more so than the hollows under the pillion seat. No, they're not grab rails, and no, there's no earthly reason for them to exist, but are we glad they do, else we wouldn't have had this photograph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/top-bikes-images/articles/10.jpg" alt="Ten best photos of BikeWale Track Day 2016" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">Dynamism is something we always want to convey with a supersports motorcycle, and this photo has it in spades. The motion blur of the track and grass, the water being flung up and past the subject, and the contrast in the sunshine reflecting off the bodywork are what made us select this image for our list.</p>
