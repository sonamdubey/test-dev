    <p class="article-paragraph">Sport riding enthusiasts exhibit a fundamental need to go faster. Those who prefer straight line speed yearn to end up on a drag strip while the rest like us who enjoy the art of cornering crave for a track day. So after a lot of head-scratching and brainstorming, we ended up on the Madras Motor Racing Track near Chennai for the inaugural BikeWale Track Day. We also brought along our favourite street bikes, my weapon of choice being the carburetted TVS Apache RTR 200 4V.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The fuel injected Apache RTR 200 4V has been a part of our long term fleet for quite some time now. It has proved its mettle as a delightful commuter and an adept touring motorcycle. However, TVS takes pride in the Apache's racing lineage, which means that it has a lot to live up to at the MMRT. We know that the Apache can get you to a race track with a smile plastered on your face, but does it pack enough firepower to double up as a track bike?</p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The weather though had something different in store for us. Our weekend at the track coincided with the onset of Cyclone Nada. Sriperumbudur along with a vast region of Tamil Nadu had to face heavy downpours accompanied by gusty winds. Nonetheless, this gave us time to get a closer look at our bikes.</p>

    <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The Apache RTR 200 4V looks equally at ease in this company as it would in a crowded city street. For the past two generations it seemed like TVS was trying too hard to make the Apache look radical. With the RTR 200 4V it has now hit the perfect balance. It also gets bells and whistles like KYB suspension, fully digital instrumentation with lap time recorder, 0-60kmph recorder and top speed recorder and sticky Pirelli tyres. ABS will soon join this list.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">When the clouds cleared, we got a chance to hit the track and gauge our motorcycles. A sportbike usually has peaky engine, which makes it a hoot to ride at high speeds. The Apache however, being a streetfighter, takes a different approach. What it has is strong bottom-end and mid-range torque. Coupled with the bike's feathery 148 kilogram kerb weight, the 20 horsepower engine gives you a spirited drive as you get on the gas on the corner exit. It allows you to enter the corner a gear higher and make the most of the mid-range while powering out. On the straights though, the lack of top end does leave you wishing for more.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">While I have always had a problem with the spongy brakes on our long term Apache, the ones on this test bike had significantly better bite and progression that allowed me to brake late. The Apache's front suspension is set up for a soft ride, something which is pronounced under heavy braking. Nevertheless, this front dive is predictable and I quite like it this way. A stiff suspension would be better for tackling corners, but would ruin the bike's ride comfort. It is the same story with the monoshock. The rear might feel slightly wobbly through the bumpy sections of the track but it never veers off its line, which is a perfectly acceptable compromise.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The rearset footpegs and sculpted tank allow a firm grip on the bike. While entering a corner, even a slight push on the inner bar is enough to tip it in. For most of the part, I struggled with sticking to the racing line and the changing track conditions didn't help my case. Nonetheless, the front end allowed mid-corner corrections whenever I went in too hot or picked the wrong line. Partly responsible for inspiring this confidence are the optional Pirelli Angel CT tyres, which offered fantastic grip on both dry and damp surfaces. TVS thought it appropriate to position the rear disc brake's master cylinder exactly where the right heel plate should have been. So there is a plastic cover in place of the heel plate making it impossible to symmetrically lock your ankles.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">Everything about the Apache is athletic, the exhaust makes it sound bigger than it is and the equipment list oozes sophistication, but to me all of this was overshadowed by its sheer versatility. The Yamaha had road-biased tyres, the Benelli felt obese and lazy while the Ducati was just too expensive to mess around with. Yes I am nit-picking, but it goes to strengthen my case as to how well the Apache was suited for the track.</p>
