    <p class="article-paragraph">The track was wet. I was wet. The Innova in front from which tracking shots were being taken was spraying water from the track onto me. The driver of the Innova didn't know the track very well and kept taking unpredictable lines. I was on a racetrack after three years, and on a supersport motorcycle for the first time in forever. The amount of self-confidence I had at that point was so low, it wouldn't have managed to fill a medium-sized puddle on the track. "Why am I here?" I thought, and not in an existential way. To add to my misery, when we took to the track a little later on all our motorcycles, I was slower than Ranjan on the Apache RTR. And I was on a Ducati 959 Panigale.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">I don't like supersport motorcycles. I've gotten over wanting to go screaming from one point to another and admiring how quick I was while doing it. However, when the Panigale rolled in to the pits on the back of a flatbed, none of us could resist whipping out our phones and taking photos - including me. This is one pretty machine, despite it being the ‘cut-price' one from the Panigale range. It doesn't get a single-sided swingarm, for example, or fancy LED cornering headlamps. Nevertheless, it was the quickest motorcycle at our inaugural BikeWale Annual Track Day, and it certainly got appreciation for the way it looked.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The unseasonal rain at Chennai was thanks to cyclone Nada - we'd all packed for hot weather, but we greeted by storm clouds at the airport. The wind picked up that night, and the next morning we woke to a grey, wet day. This was not good. The Panigale has rider modes, of course - there's ABS, traction control, engine braking control… Even so, the adage that ‘real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every single time' kept running through my head, and my confidence was so low, I was using lean angles that would embarrass even a cruise ship. My chicken strips weren't so much chicken strips as they were whole chickens.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The sun did come out, though, and the track began drying out slowly but surely. Omkar lent me a dry shirt, and we waited for the track to get dry enough to ride around. Miraculously, it did, and around and around we went. There were damp patches and wet bits, so I left the Panigale in ‘Wet' mode, which keeps the ABS and traction control on the highest interference settings, and the engine braking on the lowest setting. My aches and pains from the uncomfortable riding position took a backseat, as I tried harder to get things right. Every lap, every corner, there was something new to focus on, and all the things I'd read about in many ‘how to ride' motorcycle books started happening. What the books don't tell you is how foolish you feel when you first try them out, and you only realise when you see the images that you're getting the body position halfway correct.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The 959 Panigale spec sheet says it weighs 200kg, but it only feels that way when you're pushing it along. Fire it up, snick it into first, give it some gas, and it leaps forth in the correct mode. Even in the Wet mode around the track in Chennai, you find it a little too jerky because most corners are second-gear corners for the 959. The longest straight is the start-finish straight, and you barely have time to grab fourth before you have to brake for the next corner. As a result, you feel that its 156 horses are a little too much for the space offered here and maybe it will perform better on a track like the one in Delhi, with more space and the provision to let the Panigale settle into the sweeping bends offered there.  Put a little faith in the Panigale's electronics and tyres, though, ride a little harder, and it morphs from a difficult machine to something that feels alive. Sure, it works you hard, but the harder you work it, the more it rewards you. It gets easy to lay the power down because of the aforementioned electronics and tyres (note to self: warm them up first!), and the braking is so powerful, I had to accelerate, then brake again for the entry to the corners at the end of the straights. It even threatened to throw me over the ‘bars at the end of the start-finish straight. All this while you have the accompaniment of the soulful soundtrack of that 90-degree engine, with pops and bangs on the downshifts.  By the end of our event, my chicken strips were respectable, and even Kapil, our photographer, was satisfied with the lean angles, which is a rare occurrence.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">In the evening light, half-hidden in the shadows, the 959 Panigale looked like a 916 - quite possibly the most beautiful sportbike ever made. I'm still not a fan of supersport motorcycles, especially when it rains, but how can you not fall in love with a motorcycle that looks and goes the way this one does? The 959 Panigale let me explore my limits further than I ever have in just a couple of days: all it needs is the right attitude. Despite Cyclone Nada and its raining on our parade, and despite my dislike for supersport motorcycles, the Panigale has wormed itself into my heart, and I now know what I want for Christmas.</p>
