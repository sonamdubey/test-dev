    <p class="article-paragraph">Brake. Downshift. Turn in. Lean. The apex is here. Throttle, throttle, throttle. I kept looking at everything in detail, while it played back in a loop. Trying to see if I could go further into the corner, brake later. And that is when my mom woke me. “What are you blabbering in your sleep!” she exclaimed. I woke up rather confused the night after I returned from the Inaugural BikeWale Track day. In my years of motorcycling and innumerable attempts at getting to a racetrack, this was my first experience and getting over it is going to be more difficult than getting over my first breakup. I am in love with the Yamaha YZF-R3, my partner in crime - the crime of trying to go faster every time around the MMRT.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">We chose the R3 for a reason. There are three entry-level sport motorcycles worth considering: the KTM RC390, Kawasaki Ninja 300 and Yamaha YZF-R3. The KTM is too hardcore for the daily grind. The Kawasaki and the Yamaha give a good mix of comfortable riding and track ability, especially the Yamaha R3. The engine is torquey at low revs to putter around and the seat is soft, making life around town easy. With 41bhp on tap, it also guns to a top whack of nearly 180kmph. A perfect candidate, then, for our commuter-cum-track-tool story.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">So we landed in Chennai carrying the best sunscreen money could buy and were greeted with clouds and the cyclone Nada. Blimey, the track would be wet. What would we do now? With the schedule set, we headed to the track nonetheless. By then, it had started pouring. I was yet to be introduced to the R3, my partner for the track day. I did not know the track, either. I felt like Indiana Jones, treading into the unknown, a scary one at that.</p>

    <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
        <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/yamaha-yzf-images/articles/02.jpg" alt="Yamaha YZF-R3" src="" border="0" />
    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The Yamaha R3 welcomed me with a warm hug. I was at home on it the instant I swung my leg over. It felt comfortable and not too focussed. The track wasn't as welcoming. There was standing water and running streams to add to the technically challenging course. Led by Charles and on tenterhooks, I ventured on the track. With the little speed that we could carry, I got to learn my way around the track rather quickly.</p>

    <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
        <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/yamaha-yzf-images/articles/03.jpg" alt="Yamaha YZF-R3" src="" border="0" />
    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">And then the skies cleared. Never in Chennai was I so happy to see the sun. It meant that the track would dry up and I could go faster. Push myself into the world of sport riding that has eluded me till now. The R3 turned out to be the perfect companion. The chassis, the brakes, the rev-happy engine and the butter-smooth gearbox. They all work in such great tandem that I wanted to stop for a moment and just admire it. And that I did, albeit when it was being shot by the cameras.</p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">As Keith Code says, you have 100 cents of brain space to use for sport riding. The more you spend on worrying about the motorcycle, the less you can concentrate on going faster. The R3 is so intuitive that you hardly worry about the motorcycle. As the track dried up, the cents I spent on worrying about the grip were put to better use - riding fast.</p>

    <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
        <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/yamaha-yzf-images/articles/04.jpg" alt="Yamaha YZF-R3" src="" border="0" />
    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">I began concentrating on every corner every time I went around it. I memorised the gear, the braking points, my body position, the exit line and the next corner. The next time the target would be to tick one pointer off and save those pennies to invest in the other pointers. And I could do it. Not immediately, but after a few laps. Each time round I felt I was going slower so I tried harder.</p>

    <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
        <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/yamaha-yzf-images/articles/05.jpg" alt="Yamaha YZF-R3" src="" border="0" />
    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">That is how good the R3 is. It sticks to the tarmac even with MRF Zapper rubber. The braking is phenomenal especially with its bite and progression. The chassis, in spite of being a heavier conventional diamond frame, is a gem. It takes everything you throw at it. The suspension is a little too soft for a track machine but with the right damping, the R3 is difficult to unsettle, even on the bumpy C1 and C12. The tyres did tell you about the freshly laid patches on the track but once I knew how to get around, I didn't need to bother any more. The rear-set foot pegs provide generous cornering clearance, egging you to lean further. And that is when I remembered Vikrant's sermon - you are fast only when you finish the lap, so make sure you do that.</p>

        <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/yamaha-yzf-images/articles/06.jpg" alt="Yamaha YZF-R3" src="" border="0" />
    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">By the end of the day I was grinning from ear to ear. Yes, I made some mistakes and got shouted at as well. But then the happiness of being able to whack the throttle open at the apex was too much to subdue. All thanks to the Yamaha R3 who stood by me, smiling under that aggressive face and forgiving my little mistakes on my way to speed. No wonder it became the team's favourite track tool even with the Ducati and Benelli around!</p>
