    <p class="article-paragraph">There's one thing motorcycles have in common - they're fun. No, really. Even if it is a lowly 100cc commuter, give it the right situation and a dollop of creativity, and you will end up grinning like the Cheshire Cat. But can our regular-Joe road bikes perform well when tested to the limit at the racetrack? The inaugural BikeWale Track Day gave us the perfect opportunity to find out. We chose four motorcycles that we knew were good on the road (and cheated a bit on one - but we're sure you'll forgive us). Here they are then:</p>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <p class="article-paragraph-heading">TVS Apache RTR 200 4V</p>

        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The Apache has been in demand ever since it entered our long-term fleet, and Ranjan has had his hands full trying to dodge the requests for the Apache because it is such a fun motorcycle on the road. He's got one of his wishes fulfilled when we chose the RTR for track duty as well - here is what he felt about his beloved RTR on the racetrack.</p>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Yamaha YZF-R3</p>

        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">

        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The R3 has been Omkar's unicorn; we've been trying to get it for a review for him for so many months, he was convinced it was a mythical creature… until now. Those of us who have ridden the R3 always wanted it included in this track test because of its handling prowess. Did Omkar like it as much as we did, though?</p>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Benelli TNT 600i ABS</p>

        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/introduction-images/articles/04-benelli-tnt-600i-abs.jpg" alt="Benelli TNT 600i ABS" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">If there's one thing Pratheek likes, it is statistics - and the stats tell us that the TNT 600i is the highest-selling 4-cylinder motorcycle in the market. Not everyone is going to have more than one big motorcycle, so Pratheek had to find out if this, the most popular of i4s, was any good at the track.</p>

    <div class="article-content-section">
        <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Ducati 959 Panigale</p>

        <div class="bg-loader-placeholder article-image-margin">
            <img class="article-image lazy" data-original="/m/images/trackday/introduction-images/articles/05-ducati-959-panigale.jpg" alt="Ducati 959 Panigale" src="" border="0" />
        </div>

        <p class="article-paragraph">The previous three motorcycles are all examples of excellent motorcycles for daily use. We had to have something approach it from the other direction, and the 959 Panigale was the obvious choice. Of course, we had to hand it to Charles, who doesn't like supersport motorcycles, because if anything could change his mind, this was it. Did the plan succeed?</p>
