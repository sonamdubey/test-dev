    <p class="article-paragraph">At first glance, taking the TNT 600i to a racetrack doesn't make sense because it is a comfortable street bike. We decided to get it anyway, because this bike has changed the premium segment in India. It is the highest selling inline-four motorcycle in the country, thanks to the lovely exhaust note and very attractive pricing. With nearly two thousand of them on the road, there will be at least a few owners who would want to take their Benellis to a racetrack for uninterrupted fun. So the TNT 600i ABS came along to the MMRT at Chennai. </p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">We were supposed to have three whole days at the track, but cyclone Nada had different plans. We were invited by a wet track. I was a worried man because it was my first experience riding a motorcycle on a race track. To make things worse, the TNT 600i doesn't have a traction control system. There's ABS, yes, but traction control would have helped my confidence immensely. Many prayers to the rain god later, the track was dry enough to ride around. I had 84 horses to unleash that day, but I wanted to take things slowly because I was riding a 231kg motorcycle. The most important aspect is to get comfortable with the track and the bike first, before twisting the throttle all the way. </p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The TNT 600i is a street bike, so the ergonomics are not really track friendly. A high-set handlebar, footpegs that aren't rearset and the lack of a windscreen made it difficult for track use but they don't make it impossible. I've ridden the TNT600i a lot on the road where it performed well, but taking this Italian to the track revealed a lot. Its 231kg kerb weight is tough to handle on a short track like the MMRT. The front-biased weight distribution means tipping it into the corners and getting it back up is an effort, which is not something you want at a racetrack. The ability to change direction quickly is a minimum requirement here and the Benelli doesn't quite live up to that expectation. That's not to say it can't handle the corners; but it just feels lazy. Let's just say that I didn't miss my gym workouts. </p>

    <p class="article-paragraph">However, I was impressed with the suspension. Even though the setup has been tuned for city use, the performance of the 50mm forks and monoshock was good. The front doesn't dive unnecessarily under braking, keeping things well in control at corner entry. How I wish the TNT 600i had fewer kilos! There is a positive side to this excessive weight; I didn't find myself swimming in two massive puddles on the track because the motorcycle glided over them with no drama. Credit is also due to the Pirelli Angel ST tyres, which offered plenty of grip on a damp track as well. These tyres are primarily used for sport touring but I must say, they acquit themselves well at the track, too. </p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">The 600cc inline-four motor on the TNT600i makes so much sense for a track like the MMRT. 84bhp won't scare even a novice and the linear power delivery means it is friendly. The peak power arrives only at 11,500rpm which is where the redline lies. The low torque figure at low and mid revs and long throttle travel had me twisting the throttle a lot to churn out the required acceleration. This is unusual for a bike this size but is a plus point for a novice at a racetrack. Most of the time was spent in second and third due to the track layout. On the straights, the Benelli as it crosses the 7000rpm is pure aural bliss. I could see few appreciative heads popping out of the pit lane as I flew past.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">Things took a downturn the end of the straight because the brakes on the Benelli are a bit of a disappointment. The bite and the power isn't up to the mark for a race track, and the 231kg kerb weight doesn't help. There was a sudden loss of front brake pressure twice. This happened only during high speed stops but was good enough to calm me down.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="article-paragraph">At the end of the two days, I had my fair share of fun and ‘oh sh*t' moments but it was clear that the Benelli TNT600i makes more sense for road use. You can get the TNT 600i to a racetrack, but it is too much effort for too little gain. I can't help but think a smaller, lighter motorcycle would have offered me more confidence, and that in turn would have allowed me to focus more on riding than worrying. Next time I'm going to switch motorcycles with Ranjan, he's been having way too much fun on that Apache! </p>
