                	    <h3>Why should I book my bike at BikeWale?</h3>
                        <p>Booking is the only way to immediately block the offers that come with a particular bike on BikeWale. Once you book your bike at BikeWale, you become entitled to avail any offers mentioned against the bike model, along with securing the mentioned price for the bike. Since most offers are limited in number and available for a limited period, you should use booking option to secure them before they expire.</p>

                	    <h3>How can I book a bike on BikeWale?</h3>
                        <p>To book a bike, you have to pay a fixed booking amount online mentioned against the vehicle of your interest. This amount will be adjusted in the total on-road price of the bike. Your payment gets transferred to BikeWale through a fully-secured payment gateway.</p>

                	    <h3>What happens when I book a bike on BikeWale?</h3>
                        <p>On successful receipt of the booking payment, we will immediately send you a Booking Confirmation receipt on your email and SMS, which contains the following information:</p>

                        <p>Yes, you will get a call from the assigned dealership after you have booked a bike on BikeWale to schedule your visit to dealership. You will be required to go to the dealership to complete the remaining procedure and take delivery of the vehicle. Please carry the print out of Booking Confirmation, required documents for RTO / Bank Loan, remaining payment amount etc to the dealership to avoid multiple visits. You can yourself call the dealership on the mentioned contact numbers to fix-up a visit. We do send dealership contact details on your email and SMS, apart from showing them on website.</p>
