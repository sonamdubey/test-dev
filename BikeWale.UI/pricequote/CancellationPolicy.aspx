                <li>BikeWale strongly recommends you to carefully select your bike before pre-booking. However, you still have the option to cancel a pre-booking in case you change your mind. For all valid cancellation requests, full pre-booking amount will be refunded back to you.  If you choose to cancel a pre-booking, you can email us the <strong>‘Pre-Booking Cancellation Request’</strong> on <a class="blue" href="mailto:contact@bikewale.com">contact@bikewale.com</a> with a valid reason for cancellation, clearly stating the pre-booking reference number, your mobile number, email address (that you used while pre-booking). Please note the following conditions to request cancellation and avail refund.
