                <h3>Pratheek Kunder</h3>
                <p>Pratheek is someone who enjoys travel. Given a choice, he prefers doing so on two wheels.He has been on BikeWale since its inception and has been instrumental in setting up the content for the site.
                    A Computer Science graduate, and student of marketing, he lives by the motto "Twist of the wrist is the best way to find inner peace".  
                   Inner peace is what he finds during his vast commute from home (suburbs of Mumbai) to office (Navi Mumbai), which is why waking him up at 3AM is somewhat difficult. This difficulty however ceases to exist if you attach a “Motorcycle Ride" to that plan. Attach “Food” to that plan, and our man might just skip sleeping! </p>
                   <p>Being an ex-software analyst, you will find him fiddling with things under the pretext of debugging and giving feedback (even if you did not want it in the first place)
                 Trust him to beta test every bit of development that happens on BikeWale with the same amount of zeal as in covering a motorcycle launch, or a motoring event.
                   When not working, or sleeping, or eating, you will find him exploring new places around the Konkan belt. Be ready to be spammed, if he is ever left alone with a camera in any of these trips. An amateur photographer with an acute philosophical side and not so cute dimension, our 6 foot and odd tall man is softy at core. That is unless you try to sneak out with his motorcycle or food.
                   The easiest way to keep him busy is to start a topic about motorcycles. Chances are that if you leave the room, he will still be talking by the time you are back. With this passion for motorcycling, Pratheek finds himself at home at BikeWale with fellow  auto crazy people.</p>
