			<div data-trigger="7. How can I avail two-wheeler loan?">
              <div className="faq-list-item__content">Today, there are broadly two institutions from where you can avail a two-wheeler loan:<br/>
				  <ul className="faq-content__list">
					<li><b>Banks -</b> From state-owned banks to private to commercial banks, all offer two-wheeler loan whether you have an account with them or not, provided you satisfy the requirements set out by them.</li>
